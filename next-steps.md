1. **Enhance Docker Compose Configurations**  
   - Verify service dependencies using `depends_on` and implement health checks to ensure that containers with interdependencies only start once their required services are ready.  
   - Securely manage environment variables and secrets (consider using a `.env` file or Docker secrets for production setups).  
   - Check and confirm volume mappings and network settings to ensure smooth file sharing and inter-container communication.  
   - Review container entrypoints and logging configurations to guarantee that the startup order and debug output are correctly handled.

2. **Improve Python Script Workflows**  
   - **Input Validation & Preprocessing:** Ensure that image and text inputs are correctly validated (e.g., file existence, file types) and properly preprocessed (e.g., image resizing, text cleanup).  
   - **Title & Description Generation:** Optimize the logic for generating listing titles and descriptions so that fallback mechanisms or error messages are provided for erroneous or malformed data.  
   - **eBay API Integration:**  
     - Adjust API integration to handle authentication using the provided API keys.  
     - Implement error capturing and logging, particularly for API-related errors (rate limiting, authorization failures, etc.).  
     - Consider adding a sandbox mode to test API calls against eBay’s sandbox endpoints without impacting production data.

3. **Increase Testing and Robustness**  
   - **Integration Testing:** Create tests that simulate the complete workflow with mock text and image inputs. Include testing against eBay’s sandbox environment if possible.  
   - **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests for critical functions (like title-generation and API submission) to catch edge cases and unexpected inputs early.  
   - **Observability Enhancements:** Integrate comprehensive logging and health checks (both in Docker and within Python scripts) to receive clear signals if any step in the workflow fails.  
   - **End-to-End Testing:** Execute multiple test cycles to verify that container start-up order, service communication, and API responses work as expected.

4. **Finalize the Proof-of-Concept and Documentation**  
   - Set up a sandbox environment with eBay’s sandbox credentials to fully simulate the auto-draft workflow without affecting live data.  
   - Collect feedback from test runs and refine error handling, especially in scenarios where an image or API call fails.  
   - Update the repository’s README and documentation to clearly explain configuration options (including sandbox vs. production modes), dependencies, and known issues.  
   - Consider documenting additional test cases and examples to assist future contributors in understanding the project’s behavior.
